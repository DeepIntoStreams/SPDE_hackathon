Here data_gen Folder Details are given as follows:
- ```configs/```: Contains YAML configuration files specifying parameters for data generation (.yaml).
- ```examples/```: Provide the script for various SPDEs, which will use the core codes for SPDE solver (.py).
- ```src/```: Core scripts for SPDE solver generation (.py).
- ```utility/```: Supporting functions for the core codes (.py).
- ```notebook/```: Jupyter notebooks for experimenting with and visualizing the generated data (.ipynb)
